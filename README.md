**I say:**

A link to a cool place is found [here](http://www.bbc.com)

And you'll find there:

- bananas
- peaches

1. A nested list should start here
  1. Then move to branches
  2. And another
2. Then return to the main branch
  1. Which has its own branch
  2. and another
  3. and one more for good luck

So we're dealing with this:
- [x] Practising things
- [ ] Making things
- [ ] Doing things
